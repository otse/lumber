Preword
I like to write code...but that's it. No actual game. Here are some of my bad ideas:

Den of evil
A mine with ore, monsters and rewards. Would look good isometric.

Oracle / Gazebo
"There may be bats... soon..."

Necromancy / Evilness
Things inconspicously and slowly wither and die around you

Starting Area - Farm
Several large fields and a granary. It provides wheat for all.

Runescape, OSRS
I look dreamily at runescape.
